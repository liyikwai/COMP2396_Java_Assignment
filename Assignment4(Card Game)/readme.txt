This assignment tests your understanding of GUI programming in Java and your 
programming skills. 

 

In this assignment, you are going to implement a simple card game. The computer will 
simulate the dealer. When the game starts, 52 playing cards will be shuffled and the 
player is given $100. At each round of the game, both the player and the dealer will be 
given 3 cards (they are drawn from the top of the deck). Player will place his/her bet 
(the amount must be integer). Then before the dealer opens the cards, the player has a 
chance to draw AT MOST two cards from the top of the deck to replace any two of the 
cards on hand and each card on hand can only be replaced ONCE. Player will lose the 
bet if the dealer got a better hand (see below for explanation), otherwise the player wins 
the same amount of money as his/her bet.
