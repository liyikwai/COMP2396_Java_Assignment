This assignment tests your understanding on GUI, Java Socket Programming and the 
application of multi-threading. 

 

In this assignment, you are going to implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe Game. The 
game would only start when the Tic-Tac-Toe Server runs and two players are connected 
to the server. When the game starts, players need to input their player¡¯s name first (i.e. 
the player cannot make any move if he/she does not enter his/her player¡¯s name. Players are not allowed to re-input their names again once they have submitted their 
names (i.e. the textboxes and the submit buttons should be disabled). In addition, their 
names should be displayed in the frame¡¯s title (i.e. change from Tic Tac Toe to Tic Tac 
Toe-Player: (player¡¯s name)) and the message title (located below the menu bar) should 
change from ¡°Enter your player name¡­¡± to ¡°WELCOME (player¡¯s name)¡± .

These *.java documents basically fulfil the requirements of assignment5. 
The running method of this programe is the same as the demo video in moodle.

To run the programme:
Step1: launch 3 terminal and enter the directory containing these documents.
Step2: Compile these java documents by command line "javac *.java"
Step3: The first terminal runs the 'TicTacToeServer' programme by command line "java TicTacToeServer"
Step4: The second and the third terminals run the 'TicTacToeClient' programme by command line "java TicTacToeClient"

After the enter the names of the two players, the game shall start.
The functionalities of the game follow the criteria of the assignment5.

There are some prerequisites of running Tic Tac Toe game successfully.
First, it is not advised to use more than two terminals to connect to the server at the same time, as the Tic Tac Toe game only served for two people.
Second, it is not advised to run the client program before the server program.
